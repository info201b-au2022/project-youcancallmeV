## Project Dynamic

* Please insert your dynamic paragraph here!!

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/Calculated Summary information.R")
print_summary_info()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
```

> Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Summary Table:  
```{r ehco = FALSE, results='asis'}
source("../source/Table of summary information.R")
library(knitr)
kable(college_table[1:22, ], caption = "Data table for universities in Washington")
```

## Charts
Following are the three charts we computed for our project: 

Chart #1: 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
