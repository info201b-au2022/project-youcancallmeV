## Introduction
College application process can be frustrating. Getting information on colleges and universities, writing application essays, keeping track of various deadlines, as well as balancing school life is usually extremely challenging. In order to help the users experiencing difficulties, our project enables students to search for specific data (e.g. total number of enrollments, ACT/SAT scores, tuition) on a university. This helps the users to save time as all the information is in one place which makes the overall research process of the university faster and more efficient. We are planning to have a search bar where you could search for a specific university, as well as a filter function where you could find universities by their geographical location, cost of admission (tuition), percentage of race and gender, acceptance rate, and more.

## Problem Domain
Direct and Indirect Stakeholders
The direct stakeholder in our project is high school seniors and potential college students in the United States. Our data and visualization would provide them with useful information that eases their pressure on searching for the best college for each individual. The indirect stakeholder of the project would be college admissions officers. Colleges that are less well known yet obtain desirable characteristics will be exposed more to potential college students.

## Research Questions

## The Dataset
| Title | Number of Variables | Number of observations | Citation/URLs |
| ------------- | -------------  | ------------- |  ------------- |
|IPEDS Data | 108 | 1534 | College Admissions. (2018, November 27). Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samsonqian/college-admissions |

## Expected Implications
Following are the two implications of our project:
* We expect our findings to provide simple to comprehend data visualizations that help the user more succinctly review their options in college enrollment.
* Additionally, the data analysis that we plan to do, will allow for the public at large as well as specific donors to have an overview of each collegeâ€™s student body demographics and background to determine if they want to support their admissions processes.

## Limitations
This data is slightly out of date. The data was published on Kaggle approximately 4 years ago, meaning that it does not provide the most accurate information about current American colleges. Additionally, the intended user is likely to seek additional data regarding colleges that will affect their selections such as University ranking, cost of tuition, availability of housing, etc. that our dataset does not provide.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the individual, Samson Qian, who had published this data on Kaggle. This data collection have gave us a lot of inspiration on our project.

## Appendix A: Questions
One of the question concerned about this project is the complexity of our data. Since the data we find have 108 variables, it is impossible for us to use all the data that are provided. While building our project, can we select the data that we think it's necessary to include?
