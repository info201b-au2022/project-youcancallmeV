## Introduction
College application process can be frustrating. Getting information on colleges and universities, writing application essays, keeping track of various deadlines, as well as balancing school life is usually extremely challenging. In order to help the users experiencing difficulties, our project enables students to search for specific data (e.g. total number of enrollments, ACT/SAT scores, tuition) on a university. This helps the users to save time as all the information is in one place which makes the overall research process of the university faster and more efficient. We are planning to have a search bar where you could search for a specific university, as well as a filter function where you could find universities by their geographical location, cost of admission (tuition), percentage of race and gender, acceptance rate, and more.

## Problem Domain
Direct and Indirect Stakeholders
The direct stakeholder in our project is high school seniors and potential college students in the United States. Our data and visualization would provide them with useful information that eases their pressure on searching for the best college for each individual. The indirect stakeholder of the project would be college admissions officers. Colleges that are less well known yet obtain desirable characteristics will be exposed more to potential college students.
