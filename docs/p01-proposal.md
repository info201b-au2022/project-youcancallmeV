## Abstract
In this project, we are concerned with whether potential college students have an efficient way of selecting a suitable college in the United States. Because there are so many colleges and universities in America, it becomes complicated when doing research. To address this concern, we plan to design a simple tool that allows users to select colleges ( colleges/universities included in our database) based on different characteristics(e.g. SAT scores, race population percentage, undergraduate enrollment, etc.)

## Keywords
Education; Identity (Race, Gender); Admission; Department; Acceptance rate; Enrollment; Graduation

## Introduction
The college application process can be frustrating. Getting information on colleges and universities, looking for financial aid, looking for the desired degree, as well as balancing school life is usually extremely challenging. To help the users experiencing difficulties, our project enables students to search for specific data (e.g. total number of enrollments, ACT/SAT scores, tuition) on a university. Our project plans to help the users to save time as all the information is in one place which makes the overall research process of the university faster and more efficient. For our project, we plan to have a search bar where users can search for information regarding a specific university. Moreover, we plan to design a filter function that allows users to select colleges that has specific characteristics. For example, users would be able to select colleges that give student loan aid to first-year students, colleges that have a high percentage of a certain race, and moreover.

## Problem Domain
**_Direct and Indirect Stakeholders_**
* The direct stakeholder in our project including potential college students in the United States, college admissions, and universities in general _(Who Are Key Website Project Stakeholders in Higher Education?, 2022)_. Our data and visualization would provide students with useful information that eases their pressure on searching for the best college for each individual. The indirect stakeholder of the project would be college promotion departments. By having more exposure from the website, colleges that are less well known yet obtain desirable characteristics will be exposed more to potential students .

**_Human values_**
* Human values such as "inclusion", "accessibility" and "respect" are paramount human values within this problem domain _(Shahin et al., 2022)_. We planned this project with the ideas of equity and opportunity in mind in reference to the process that colleges use to determine admission to their school. We want to give an opportunity for people all over who are considering any American university the ability to see and determine for themselves if the colleges that they are considering match with their idea of acceptance and respect. Are these schools equally accepting of all people, and do they treat their prospective students with equal respect.

**_Possible harms and benefits_**
* Benefits: Filtering information and making the college searching process easier; give less well-known colleges more exposure. Additionally, it allows anyone to have easy access to simple-to-understand data visualizations that assist them in analyzing how each college handles admissions. This has many benefits, whether it be alumni questioning if they support the decisions of their alma mater, which may help them determine if they wish to donate to the school. Or prospective professors or workers who are questioning if the place they might work at next aligns with, or is a gross contradiction to their own personal values. Or, as it is relevant to current times, how might this data be affected by affirmative action, and is the actuality of the situation something that someone might wish to support. Similarly, this may assist the average person who is following the current supreme court case in understanding the statistical side of the multi-faceted issue.
* Harms: May direct views to incorrect conclusions based on the relatively limited amount of data in our dataset. Similarly, it may also cause users to disregard more important, user-specific information such as budget or personal geographical location. Similarly, there is a chance that this data, as it is slightly out of date, may confuse the reader and cause them to falsely interpret it as data defining the current times rather than treating it as a snapshot of the past. Another potential harms of a selecting tool is it might leads to "over-research" without realizing that "no one institution will fill all requirements" _(Dix, 2016)_.  


## Research Questions

* How can we improve the data set?
  * This question is important because understanding the data is crucial when utilizing them for a purpose of our own project. This enables us to think in depth and critically, which helps to make a reliable and more powerful project.

* How does admissions for each American university relate on the factor of race of admitted students to the racial breakdown of the surrounding city's population?
  * This is important because this is a genuine implemented process which reflects upon the character of the University. Many incoming college students place value upon the moral standings of people, organizations, and corporations. Colleges are no exception. Understanding the values of the institution that one will choose to spend four or more years at is of the utmost importance to many students, especially in the current political climate.

## The Dataset (400 words)

Our central question of this project revolves around the process of choosing college for individuals that are considering going to college. Personally speaking, as college undergraduate students, we believe college searching can be tiring and time consuming for everyone. There are numerous colleges and universities across the land of the United States, and it would be a complex process for people to choose the one and only. The data set we have found, covered around 1534 institutions in America and 108 characteristic that colleges might obtain. This data set is a  collection of critical information regarding colleges that we are interested in. In this case, we believe this data set would serves our project the best since we intend to build a tool that benefits potential college students the best, and help them reduce their work load as much as possible.

* Author and potential beneficiary
  * We obtained our data set on the internet by searching public data on admission information regarding universities across the United States. The collector of the data is named Samson Qian who is currently studying his master's at MIT. He did not elaborate on the purpose behind this data collection. We believe the creator of this data has no intention of gaining money with this data since it is posted on an open website and licensed in the public domain. Individuals doing college admission-related projects will benefit from this data, just like our project. For example, individuals who are doing a SAT/ACT score research might benefit from this data set. Moreover, individuals who are searching for college information might also benefit from this data if they search directly in the data set.

* Validity and credibility
  * Through our research, we find that there might be an issue with the credibility of this database. Our data set was collected on Kaggle, and posted by Samson Qian, who is currently doing a master's of Finance student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying Financial Engineering, graduating in December 2022. We have the information of the author which can be somewhat reliable but he does not provide information on where he got the data from which decreases the credibility of the dataset. Yet, we find a lot of the information that are included in the data set to match with the current information of colleges (For example, location, zip code). That gives certain validity to our data set.

## Expected Implications (67/150)
Following are the two implications of our project:
* We expect our findings to provide simple to comprehend data visualizations that help the user more succinctly review their options in college enrollment.
* Additionally, the data analysis that we plan to do, will allow for the public at large as well as specific donors to have an overview of each collegeâ€™s student body demographics and background to determine if they want to support their admissions processes.

## Limitations
Following are couple of limitations of our projects and database
  * Even though our project provides the basic details of institutions, it does not include some key information such as the application deadline. We believe it is important for potential college students to know their deadlines yet our database does not include this information.
  * This data is slightly out of date. The data was published on Kaggle approximately 4 years ago, meaning that it does not provide the most accurate information about current American colleges. Additionally, the intended user is likely to seek additional data regarding colleges that will affect their selections such as University ranking, availability of housing, etc. that our dataset does not provide.
  * Some of the data are not available which limits the amount of data as well as the reliability of the data set itself. For example, Athens State University does not have data on the number of applicants, admission total, acceptance rate, and more. This could be because the university itself is not sharing the information with the public. This can be difficult for students who may be seeking to apply to the university. Overcoming the inconsistencies in the data set is difficult but we could provide a link or a list of the university website or phone number so that it can be easier for the users to gain information.

## Appendix A: Questions
One of the question concerned about this project is the complexity of our data. Since the data we find have 108 variables, it is impossible for us to use all the data that are provided. While building our project, can we select the data that we think it's necessary to include?
